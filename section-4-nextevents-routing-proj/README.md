# Section - 4: Practice project for NextJS Routing

In section 3 we learnt the concepts of how routing works in NextJS. Here in this section we will build a small dummy Next events app to practice those concepts.

## Planning the Project

- For root page i.e., / ➡️ we will show the features events
- /events ➡️ Show all events
- /events/[id] ➡️ Show selected event details
- /events/[...slug] ➡️ Show filtered events
